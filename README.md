AS7 Example scripts
===================

After watching Jason Greene's scripting of AS7 Video
(http://vimeo.com/26363489) I thought it could be fun to create the
same in other languages.

If you know a language that is not represented here yet then send a pull request :)


deploy.pl - Perl, using standard CPAN libraries

deploy.sh - Bash with Curl

deploy.rb - Ruby with [json](https://rubygems.org/gems/json) and [rest-client](https://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client) gems

deploy.py - Python with standard libds

<your language here> - <pull request>
